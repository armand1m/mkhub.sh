makeRepo.sh
===========

This shell script makes creating new GitHub repositories easy. You can create a new GitHub repo, initialize the contents of the current directory, commit them, and push them&mdash;all at once, without opening your browser!

Recommended usage: set up a bash alias so that you can run it from any directory. 
e.g., `alias newRepo='/absolute/path/to/script/makeRepo.sh'`
